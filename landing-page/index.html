                <h2>1914 translation by H. Rackham</h2>
                <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
                    born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
                    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. To take a trivial example, which
                    of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
                    has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
                    consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>

    <section id="2" class="light-bg section">
        <div class="main-content main-text-content">
            <h2>Lorem</h2>
            <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the
                pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
                through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.</p>

            <p>These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is
                untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be
                welcomed and every pain avoided.</p>

            <p> But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
                frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore
                always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other
                greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
